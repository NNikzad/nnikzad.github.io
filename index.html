                I completed my PhD studies in the <a href="http://www.cs.ucsd.edu">Computer Science and Engineering Department</a> at the <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">University fo California, San Diego</a> in 2015.
                I was advised by <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg">William Griswold</a>. 
                I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in the Spring of 2009 with a degree in Computer Science.  While at UCLA, I was a CENS Intel Scholar and did research at the <a href="http://research.cens.ucla.edu">Center for Embedded Networked Sensing</a>.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                During graduate school, I primarily worked on two large research efforts. Much of my dissertation was based on my work on APE, or Annotated Programming for Energy-efficiency, an annotation language and middleware runtime service that eases the development of energy-management policies for use in Android applications. Much of this work was motivied by previous work on the <a href="https://sosa.ucsd.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=8257538">CitiSense</a> project, which tracked individual exposure to air pollution through an complete, end-to-end monitoring system: a body-worn sensor board, a mobile phone application for presenting feedback to users, and a back-end server for presenting personal exposure history and further analysis.
